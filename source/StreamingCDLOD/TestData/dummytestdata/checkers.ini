#This determines how much granularity LOD will have: Reduce this to reduce

# - it must be bigger or equal to 2

#RenderGridResolution (resolution of mesh grid used to render terrain quads)

# How many LOD levels to have - big heightmaps will require more LOD levels,

LODLevelDistanceRatio         = 2.0
# Determines rendering LOD level distribution based on distance from the viewer.
# Value of 2.0 should result in equal number of triangles displayed on screen

# Values above 2.0 will result in more triangles on more distant areas, and vice versa.

MinViewRange                     = 5000
# Minimum view range setting that can be set.
# View range defines range at which terrain will be visible. Setting ViewRange it
# to too low values will result in incorrect transition between LODs layers
# (warning message will be displayed on screen in that case) so that's why there's
# this minimum range specified here.
# If lower ranges than that are required, LODLevelCount must be reduced too.

MaxViewRange                     = 50000
# Maximum view range setting that can be set.
# Although there's no theoretical maximum, demo does not support too high values
